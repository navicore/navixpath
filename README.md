NAVIPATH Library for Extracting Data From XML
=====================

# Overview

This library was the "navicore data" package as the "data" utility of the
"navimatrix" project (thanks Henry).

After many years I'm working with XML again and remember this lib was my
favorite way to work with XML.

# Repositories

### todo - maven central / nexus

# Build

`mvn clean package`

# License

Because several BSD-licensed libs were embedded in the src tree, the code
still compiles in modern Java maven projects.  The origins of the embedded
deps are noted in the source files.

Unless there is a notice in the file stating otherwise, all other code is MIT
licensed.
